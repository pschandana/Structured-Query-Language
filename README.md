# SQL Problems

## Problem: Performance Improvement

You are given a table having the marks of one student in every test (Tests are held every day). You have to output the tests in which the student has improved his performance.
For a student to improve his performance he has to score more than the previous test. Given that TestIDs are in increasing order, forming a continuous sequence without any missing numbers.

| Field  | Type |
| ------ | ---- |
| TestId | INT  |
| Marks  | INT  |

## Query Result
 | TestId |
| ------ |
| 2      |
| 4      |
| 6      |
